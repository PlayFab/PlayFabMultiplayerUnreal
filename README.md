# PlayFab Multiplayer Unreal Online Subsystem (OSS)

## Introduction

The PlayFab Online Subsystem (PF OSS) v2 enables you to make use of PlayFab Multiplayer features like Lobby, Matchmaking, Party and Azure Cognitive Services in your Unreal Engine game.

These features include cross-platform Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), cross-network-play, and accessibility features like real-time text chat translation and voice transcription services. It is currently designed for use when developing PC, Xbox, Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Sony PlayStation4/PlayStation5 games. This OSS layer works seamlessly on top of the existing base platform OSS layers (such as the base GDK OSS layer provided by Epic for Xbox and PC Game Pass). PlayFab OSS compliments the base OSS by adding support for PlayFab Lobby, Matchmaking, Party networking and Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP).

## Important Note

The WinGDK version of UE5.3 is known to have an issue related to HTTP requests. Epic Games has recognized this problem and addressed it in version 5.4. To work around this issue in UE5.3, you can launch your game using the `-UseWinHttpGDK` argument to switch to WinHTTP instead of xCurl.

The PlayFab Online Subsystem (PF OSS) v2 is currently generally available (GA) for GDK and Win64+Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Sony PS4™/PS5™.

For platform certification and shipping to retail users, games must use the generally available (GA) release of the SDKs and engine plugins that will become available in the coming months.

For games shipping to Xbox console and PC Game Pass program before September 2022, it is recommended that games use the base Online Subsystem (OSS) for GDK provided by Epic for multiplayer integration (backed by Xbox Live multiplayer services) and the PlayFab Online Subsystem (PF OSS) v1.x for Party networking and VOIP available on the [GDK download website](https://aka.ms/gdkdl).
